import pandas as pd
sdata = {'Ohio': 35000, 'Texas': 71000, 'Oregon': 16000, 'Utah': 5000}
obj1 = pd.Series(sdata)
states = ['California', 'Ohio', 'Oregon', 'Texas']
obj2 = pd.Series(sdata, index=states)
obj3 = pd.isnull(obj2)

obj2['California'] == None

2. import pandas as pd
d = {'1': 'Alice','2': 'Bob','3': 'Rita','4': 'Molly','5': 'Ryan'}
