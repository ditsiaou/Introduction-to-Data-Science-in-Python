1. Consider the given NumPy arrays a and b. What will be the value of c after the following code is executed?

import numpy as np

a = np.arange(8)
b = a[4:6]
b[:] = 40
c = a[4] + a[6]


46


2. Given the string s as shown below, which of the following expressions will be True?

import re
s = 'ABCAC'

bool(re.match('A', s)) == True

3. Consider a string s. We want to find all characters (other than A) which are followed by triple A, i.e., have AAA to the right. 
We donâ€™t want to include the triple A in the output and just want the character immediately preceding AAA . 
Complete the code given below that would output the required result.

def result():
    s = 'ACAABAACAAABACDBADDDFSDDDFFSSSASDAFAAACBAAAFASD'
    import re
    result = []
    pattern = r'[B-Z](?=AAA)'

    for item in re.finditer(pattern, s): 
      result.append(item.group())

    return result
print(result())


4. Consider the following 4 expressions regarding the above pandas Series df. All of them have the same value except one expression.
Can you identify which one it is?

df.index[0]

5. Consider the two pandas Series objects shown above, representing the no. of items of different yogurt flavors that were sold in a day from two different stores,
s1 and s2. Which of the following statements is True regarding the Series s3 defined below?

s3['Mango'] >=  s1.add(s2, fill_value = 0)['Mango']

6. In the following list of statements regarding a DataFrame df, one or more statements are correct. Can you identify all the correct statements?

Every time we call df.set_index(), the old index will be discarded.
Every time we call df.reset_index(), the old index will be set as a new column.

7. Consider the Series object S defined below. Which of the following is an incorrect way to slice S such that we obtain all data points corresponding to the indices 'b', 'c', and 'd'?
S = pd.Series(np.arange(5), index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])

S['b':'e']


8. Consider the DataFrame df shown above with indexes 'R1', 'R2', 'R3', and 'R4'.  In the following code, a new DataFrame df_new is created using df. 
What will be the value of df_new[1] after the below code is executed?
f = lambda x: x.max() + x.min()
df_new = df.apply(f)

88

9. Consider the DataFrame named new_df shown above. Which of the following expressions will output the result (showing the head of a DataFrame) below? 


new_df.unstack().unstack()

10. Consider the DataFrame df shown above. What will be the output (rounded to the nearest integer) when the following code related to df is executed:

df.groupby('Item').sum().iloc[0]['Quantity sold']

30
